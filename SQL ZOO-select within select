To get a well rounded view of the important features of SQL you should move on to the next tutorial concerning aggregates.

To gain an absurdly detailed view of one insignificant feature of the language, read on.

We can use the word ALL to allow >= or > or < or <=to act over a list. For example, you can find the largest country in the world, by population with this query:

SELECT name
  FROM world
 WHERE population >= ALL(SELECT population
                           FROM world
                          WHERE population>0)
You need the condition population>0 in the sub-query as some countries have null for population.

Bigger than every country in Europe
6.
Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)

select name from world where 
gdp>(select MAX(gdp) from world where continent = 'Europe' and gdp IS NOT NULL);

Correct answer
name
China
Japan
United States
We can refer to values in the outer SELECT within the inner SELECT. We can name the tables so that we can tell the difference between the inner and outer versions.

Largest in each continent
7.
Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:

The above example is known as a correlated or synchronized sub-query.

Using correlated subqueries
select continent, name, area 
from world x
where 
area = (select max(area) from world y where x.continent = y.continent);

Correct answer
continent	name	area
Africa	Algeria	2381741
Oceania	Australia	7692024
South America	Brazil	8515767
North America	Canada	9984670
Asia	China	9596961
Caribbean	Cuba	109884
Europe	Kazakhstan	2724900
Eurasia	Russia	17125242

First country of each continent (alphabetically)
8.
List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.

where name = (select min(name) from world y where x.continent = y.continte)

Correct answer
continent	name

Caribbean	Antigua and Barbuda
Eurasia	Armenia
